# P3\_BROWN Buoyant Station-Keeping Building Prototype Project

This project uses a pi pico w to control many motors autonomously using data retrieved by a mpu6050 IMU.

## Current Features:
- read acellerometer and gyrometer info from mpu6050 sensor
- control stepper motor direction and speed

## TODO:
- use sensor readings to operate motors
- calculate accurate interpretation of position and rotation given data from sensors
